This thesis focuses on the control aspect of humanoid robots, specifically in the area of biped locomotion. This is particularly challenging research problem due to the complexity required to maintain balance of a naturally unstable and non-linear dynamic system.  

To verify the efficiency and efficacy of a novel walking control strategy presented in this thesis, I built a 14DOF bipedal robot (CAD render below). For more information pertaining to my research and/or the biped, click on the card:

### Remarks

I was inspired by [Will Robertson][5]'s approach to openly publishing his thesis and firmly support his belief that academic research should be more open.  

The main goal behind publishing this work is to provide others in a similar situation with a useful guide. My hope is that this will be an insightful resource and that every commit will serve as a snapshot of my work in progress. 

Please [contact me][4] directly if you need to to reuse/alter anything listed under this repository.
