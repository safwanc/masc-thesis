Bipedal locomotion is a highly active research area within the field of humanoid robotics. As robotics continue to push towards mainstream applications, the ability for a robotic system to navigate the human environment is essential. However, bipedal locomotion is a very challenging control problem due to the natural instability of a dynamic and nonlinear system. Over the past 40 years, most walking control strategies have revolved around constantly maintaining balance throughout the complete gait cycle. The resulting gait from these methods are energetically inefficient and appear ``robot-like''. 

A robust and energetically efficient walking control strategy is presented in this thesis. One of the many challenges with validating novel control strategies is validating simulations with physical hardware. To this end, this thesis outlines the construction of a 14 degree-of-freedom (DOF) lower body humanoid robot for the purposes of research in bipedal locomotion. The ultimate goal is to validate the effectiveness and usefulness of the presented walking control strategy by testing it on the physical biped hardware.

At the very core of the proposed walking control strategy is the Foot Placement Estimator (FPE) algorithm which has been presented for 2D bipedal robots. The FPE algorithm determines where an unstable biped must step to restore balance. The elegance of this approach lies in the fact that it can be extended to form complete gait cycles using simple PD controllers and a state machine. 

The 2D FPE algorithm is extended to form complete gait cycles for a 3D bipedal robot in simulation and ultimately, on physical hardware. Extending the 2D theory presents its own unique set of challenges which are addressed in part by using a motion control framework and selecting a 2D plane to solve the FPE algorithm. Ultimately, the efficacy of the proposed walking control strategy is demonstrated through side stepping and forward walking in dynamic simulations. 

The development of a 14 DOF bipedal robot for the purposes of research in bipedal locomotion is also presented. A rapid prototyping toolchain is developed to streamline the iterative electromechanical design process. Drivetrain component selection is performed using gait estimation and accounting for actuator dynamics. The physical 14 DOF bipedal robot is constructed and the validity of the motion control framework and actuator dynamics models are demonstrated on the physical hardware.

\label{sec:outline}
The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows. Chapter \ref{cha:background} outlines existing walking control strategies prevalent in robotics literature today. While most control strategies use a dynamic measure of balance to form complete gait cycles, some newer approaches are similar to the strategy presented in this thesis. These control strategies aim to use foot placement as a means to form robust and energetically efficient gait for bipedal locomotion. 

One of the key challenges in developing physical hardware for bipedal locomotion research is the impact of small changes in the electromechanical design on the overall stability of the system. In order to develop a system with adequate drivetrain performance to achieve walking, a toolchain is developed to streamline the process of designing a mechanical prototype in CAD and immediately analyzing its behaviour in dynamic simulations. The electromechanical design workflow using the toolchain is presented in Chapter \ref{cha:toolchain}.

Extending the current 2D FPE theory to the 3D case is presented in Chapter \ref{cha:simulations}. A motion control framework is presented in order to simultaneously use the FPE algorithm to achieve walking and maintain stability throughout the entire gait cycle. The 2D FPE theory and the proposed extension to 3D are verified through dynamic simulations. 

The development of a 14 DOF lower body humanoid robot is presented in Chapter \ref{cha:design}. Human gait is used as an approximate starting point for actuators and drivetrain component selection from local vendors. The forward dynamics and 3D visualization for the final prototype design is generated using the toolchain outlined in in Chapter \ref{cha:toolchain}. This is used to test control strategies on the 14 DOF lower body humanoid platform in simulation prior to implementing it on the physical hardware. 

Experimental validation of the actuator dynamics and motion control framework are validated on the physical hardware in Chapter \ref{cha:experiments}. The actuator dynamics models in simulation are verified to match the physical DC motors through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. The motion control framework used for extending the FPE theory to 3D is also verified on physical hardware using HIL.  

Lastly, conclusions and future work regarding the proposed walking control strategy and developed physical hardware are presented in Chapter \ref{cha:conclusion}.
