    \textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

I would like to thank my supervisor Dana Kuli\'{c} for her invaluable guidance and support throughout my research. I'm extremely grateful for her advice, paper editing, debugging sessions and countless meetings over the last two years.  

I would also like to thank the following people for their assistance during the course of my masters research: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr. Derek Wight for his advice on electromechanical design, developing models with QUARC and help with the HIL experiments. I am also grateful for the opportunity to work at Quanser Inc under the NSERC Industrial Postgraduate Scholarship. The experience was extremely valuable to the development of our streamlined toolchain during the design process. \\

    \item Christopher Kirby from Christie Digital Systems for taking the time to to provide guidance on the mechanical design. As an electrical engineering undergraduate with minimal experience and knowledge of mechanical engineering, his advice on best  practices, designing the mechanical power transmission system for the biped and generating CAD drawings was invaluable. \\

    \item Matt Millard of the Real Motion Group in Systems Design Engineering for his expertise in the field of gait analysis and for help with a wide range of topics pertaining to walking robots and contact modeling.  \\

    \item Charles Boyle at the Engineering Machine Shop on campus for his advice and assistance with manufacturing the bipedal robot. Charlie often stayed after hours and helped with machining various parts of the project.  \\

\end{itemize}

Finally, I would like to thank my family and my wife for providing their endless encouragement and support throughout my academic career at the University of Waterloo.
