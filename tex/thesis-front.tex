    \textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}

Bipedal locomotion is a challenging control engineering problem due to its non-linear dynamics and postural instability of the bipedal form. In addition to these challenges, some dynamical effects such as the ground reaction force are difficult to model accurately in simulation. To this end, it is essential to develop physical hardware to validate walking control strategies and gait generation methods. The development of a 14 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) lower body humanoid robot is presented in the first half of this thesis. 

The initial electromechanical design of the proposed system is derived from dynamic modeling of a general multibody system. Kinematic trajectories for the lower body joints are extracted from motion captured human gait data to form the preliminary design specifications. The drivetrain components are selected by analyzing the mechanical power requirements, torque-speed profiles, efficiency and thermal characteristics of actuators. The supporting mechanical chassis and power transmission system are designed to raise the center-of-mass (to reduce the swinging inertia of each leg) while minimizing the overall weight of the system. 

Refinements to the design of a complex multibody robotic system like the biped is an iterative process. The mechanical model of the system is transferred from Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) software to a dynamic simulator for analysis and the design is revised to improve performance. This iterative approach is necessary as small changes in the mechanical model can have significant impact on the overall dynamics of the system and the resulting behaviour as well as implications for control design. A streamlined prototyping toolchain is developed in this thesis to extract the relevant kinematic/dynamic parameters of a mechanical system in CAD and automatically generate the equivalent system in a dynamic simulator. This toolchain is used to revise the electromechanical design and generate forward dynamics simulations. 

The second portion of this thesis presents a novel walking control strategy for robust gait synthesis for 3D bipedal robots. Thus far, the most popular walking control strategies have used the Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) criterion as a measure of balance. These strategies use ZMP as a feedback variable to achieve walking by \emph{maintaining} balance throughout the gait cycle. An alternative problem formulation focuses on \emph{restoring} balance to an unstable system by controlling the swing foot position. The Foot Placement Estimator (FPE) algorithm determines the desired swing foot position on the ground for 2D bipedal robots. The FPE algorithm can be used as a recovery mechanism (i.e. to recover from destabilizing disturbances) with existing walking control strategies. Alternatively, it can be used with a state machine and simple local joint controllers for complete gait synthesis. The existing FPE algorithm is extended for the general case of 3D bipedal robots in this thesis. 

The proposed control strategy is verified to achieve full dynamic walking in simulation. It is important to validate complex control strategies on physical hardware due to imperfections in the simulation environment. In addition to the challenge of accurately modeling the ground reaction force, it is also difficult to include the unmodeled effects on physical hardware (i.e. vibrations, friction). To this end, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing environment is presented in this thesis. The motion control framework and joint dynamics used in the proposed walking control strategy are verified through HIL experiments.

I would like to thank my supervisor Dana Kuli\'{c} for her invaluable guidance and support throughout my research. I'm extremely grateful for her advice, paper editing, debugging sessions and countless meetings over the last two years.  

I would also like to thank the following people for their assistance during the course of my masters research: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr. Derek Wight for his advice on electromechanical design, developing models with QUARC and help with the HIL experiments. I am also grateful for the opportunity to work at Quanser Inc under the NSERC Industrial Postgraduate Scholarship. The experience was extremely valuable to the development of our streamlined toolchain during the design process. \\

    \item Christopher Kirby from Christie Digital Systems for taking the time to to provide guidance on the mechanical design. As an electrical engineering undergraduate with minimal experience and knowledge of mechanical engineering, his advice on best  practices, designing the mechanical power transmission system for the biped and generating CAD drawings was invaluable. \\

    \item Matt Millard of the Real Motion Group in Systems Design Engineering for his expertise in the field of gait analysis and for help with a wide range of topics pertaining to walking robots and contact modeling.  \\

    \item Charles Boyle at the Engineering Machine Shop on campus for his advice and assistance with manufacturing the bipedal robot. Charlie often stayed after hours and helped with machining various parts of the project.  \\

\end{itemize}

Finally, I would like to thank my family and my wife for providing their endless encouragement and support throughout my academic career at the University of Waterloo.
