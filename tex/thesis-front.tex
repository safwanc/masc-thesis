    \textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

I would like to thank my supervisor Dana Kuli\'{c} for her invaluable guidance and support throughout my research. I'm extremely grateful for the paper editing, debugging sessions and countless meetings over the last two years.  

I would also like to thank Dr. Derek Wight for providing me with the opportunity to work full time at Quanser Inc under the NSERC Industrial Postgraduate Scholarship. The experience was extremely valuable to the development of our streamlined toolchain during the design process.  

I would also like to thank Christopher Kirby from Christie Digital Systems for taking the time to provide a lot of guidance with regards to the mechanical design. As a full time mechanical engineer, he provided a great deal of advice with regards to best practices, tolerance calculations and general tips for generating descriptive 2D CAD drawings from 3D models.

Lastly, I would like to thank Matt Millard of the Real Motion Group in Systems Design Engineering for his expertise in the field of gait analysis and for help with a wide range of topics pertaining to walking robots and contact modelling. 

Finally, I would like to thank my family and my wife for providing their advice and support.
